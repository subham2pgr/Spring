The @Component annotation marks a java class as a bean so the component-scanning mechanism of spring can pick it up and pull it into the application context. To use this annotation, apply it over class as below:

@Component
public class EmployeeDAOImpl implements EmployeeDAO {
    ...
}

@Autowired annotation is used to let Spring know that autowiring is required. This can be applied to field, constructor and methods. This annotation allows us to implement constructor-based, field-based or method-based dependency injection in our components.
enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly.

 Spring Configuration annotation indicates that the class has @Bean definition methods. So Spring container can process the class and generate Spring Beans to be used in the application.

@ComponentScan annotation is used with @Configuration annotation to specify the packages to look for Component classes.
@Bean annotation is used to let Spring framework know that this method should be used to get the bean implementation to inject in Component classes.



AnnotationConfigApplicationContext constructor takes Class as argument that will be used to get the bean implementation to inject in component classes.

getBean(Class) method returns the Component object

ClassPathXmlApplicationContext is used to get the ApplicationContext object by providing the configuration files location

The @Qualifier annotation is used to resolve the autowiring conflict, when there are multiple beans of same type
context:annotation-config is used to enable annotation based configuration support.
