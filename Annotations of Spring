The @Component annotation marks a java class as a bean so the component-scanning mechanism of spring can pick it up and pull it into the application context. To use this annotation, apply it over class as below:

@Component
public class EmployeeDAOImpl implements EmployeeDAO {
    ...
}

@Autowired annotation is used to let Spring know that autowiring is required. This can be applied to field, constructor and methods. This annotation allows us to implement constructor-based, field-based or method-based dependency injection in our components.
enables you to inject the object dependency implicitly.
